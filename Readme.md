## Goals of `jarvishaus/hp-scan`

- Simplify the usage of [hp-scan](https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/tech_docs/man_pages/scan)
- Be as lightweight as possible
- Don't be a standalone application
- Be used a sidecar alongside [Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com) for example

## Usage

Run this image with a volume mounted to the `/var/scan` and your device URI specified as an environment variable while using DBUS from host:

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
	-v /run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/run/dbus/system_bus_socket \
	-v ./consume:/var/scan \
	-e DEVICE_URI=escl:https://192.168.0.1:443
	jarvishaus/hp-scan
```

## Configuration

Options for scanning may be provided as environment variables:

 * `MODE` ... Scan mode: gray, color or lineart
